            <p className="font-work-sans font-[400] text-xl">This is the first version of this product. It was a challenging time learning and understanding the complexity of a procurement product and then simplifying the experience for our users. As an associate designer on this product, I experienced a number of challenges and lessons;</p>
            <ul className="font-work-sans  list-disc pl-4 font-[400] text-xl marker:text-white space-y-2">
                <li className="">When it comes to the ‘look and feel’ of a product, as a designer, you’re used to making the final decision but on an Agile product development team like this, final decisions are discussed amongst the whole team. I may have the design expertise, but others on the team will have a solid understanding of the requirements, the market or the technical challenges involved.</li>
                <li className="">Our major focus (with the understanding we gathered from procurement experts) was to build a ‘minimum viable product’ and deliver just enough to give the user an idea of the functionality. We go back to it and make improvements based on feedback we get from our real users - our first pilot clients</li>
